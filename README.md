# HANGMAN GAME

I have made a HANGMAN GAME that you can play in  [my website](http://joanna-sobanska.pl/HANGMAN/index.html)

Main assumptions about the game:
* Using real API for fetching random word (endpoint randomWords in Wordnik), length of the words is less than 12 and any word doesn't contain chars as " ", "-" and "'".
* User has 11 lives ( with each lost there will appear a part of hangman's body).
* No chance to write any letter more than once, typing numbers is blocked.
* After the "game over" there is still possibility to play again.
* Keyboard is a controller.

Game is written in JS, I have used also a Sass technology. Parts of hangman's body have been done in CSS,
 because of that I didn't have to worry about users with Retina screens.

## ENJOY THE GAME!
